def order_match():
    '''
    Traverse the order book looking for Active orders which match
    the specified price.

    *If the order is a buy, we look for a price less than or equal.
    *If the order is a sell, we look for a price greater than or equal.
    *If itâ€™s a market order, we find the highest (sell) or lowest (buy) price.

    We sort matches ascending for buy orders, and descending for
    sell orders. Then we sort by date if the price matches.

    Generate Transaction as a result
